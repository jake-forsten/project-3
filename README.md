The main goal of this project was to create a To-do list app using the React framework. The app allows you to add tasks and a description to your to-do list, and allows you to mark them as complete. 
You can also filter the results to see what you have completed or what you still need to do. 
Finally there is a contact form which allows you to send a message to the developer (myself) directly.



User Stories-
    1. As a self-employed person, I'd like to be able to use an app where I can schedule out tasks for the week.
    2. As a busy stay-at-home parent, I would like to see what tasks I have already completed, and what I still need to get done.
    3. As a frequent user of web apps, I would like to be able to give comments and feedback to the developer directly after trying their to-do list app.
